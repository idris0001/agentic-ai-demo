# Agentic AI Demo

## Project Goals
This repository demonstrates autonomous AI agents that perform tasks with minimal human intervention. Focus is on learning Agentic AI concepts and building simple agents.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Agentic AI concepts
- Multi-step task automation
- Integrating AI models into autonomous workflows

## Structure
- `/notebooks` - Experiment notebooks
- `/src` - Python scripts for agents
- `/results` - Output and logs

## Future Work
- Build agents for text/data processing
- Combine agents with LLMs for autonomous tasks
